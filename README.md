## Hola, all√¥, hi, I'm Sergio!

With over 11 years of experience in designing, developing, and evaluating e-learning programs for large corporations across diverse industries (retail, energy, education, finance), I possess a comprehensive skillset in learning analytics, instructional design, and e-learning development. I am proficient in ensuring data quality and utilizing HR data for strategic decision-making.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. **[Amazon](https://github.com/sdforero/Amazon)**  
   This project analyzes Amazon product reviews to understand user sentiment, identify top and poorly-rated products, and examine frequent user behavior. Utilizing Python libraries like Pandas, TextBlob, and Matplotlib, the analysis revealed positive sentiment trends, highlighted products for marketing, and identified user patterns for targeted promotions.
2. **[YouTube](https://github.com/sdforero/YouTube)**  
   This project analyzes audience engagement on YouTube videos. It explores how factors like comments, likes/dislikes, and emojis influence viewership and audience entertainment. The analysis suggests positive comments and emotional engagement (punctuation, emojis) correlate with video views, indicating an entertained audience is key to video success.
